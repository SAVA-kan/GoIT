      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954.[4] His early schooling was suspended<br> in 1967 as a result of the Nigerian Civil War. At 13 years, he served in the Biafran army. After the<br> war he completed high-school equivalence through self-study.<br>
        He is married to Dale Brown Emeagwali, a noted African-American microbiologist.[5]
      </p>
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        He traveled to the United States to study under a scholarship following completion of a<br> correspondence course at the University of London. He received a bachelor's degree in<br> mathematics from Oregon State University in 1977. He later moved to Washington DC, receiving<br> in 1986 a master's degree from George Washington University in ocean and marine engineering,<br> and a second master's in applied mathematics from the University of Maryland. Next magazine<br> suggested that Emeagwali claimed to have further degrees.[6][7] During this time, he worked as a<br> civil engineer at the Bureau of Land Reclamation in Wyoming.
      </p>
      <h3>Court case and the denial of degree</h3>
      <p>
        Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan from 1987 through 1991.<br> His thesis was not accepted by a committee of internal and external examiners and thus he was<br> not awarded the degree. Emeagwali filed a court challenge, stating that the decision was a<br> violation of his civil rights and that the university had discriminated against him in several ways<br> because of his race. The court challenge was dismissed, as was an appeal to the Michigan state<br> Court of Appeals.[8]
      </p>
      <h2>Supercomputing</h2>
      <p>
        Emeagwali received the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for an application of the CM-2 massively-parallel<br> computer. The application used computational fluid dynamics for oil-reservoir modeling. He<br> received a prize in "price/performance" category, with a performance figure of about 400<br> Mflops/$1M.[15] The winner in the "performance" category, was also the winner of the<br> Price/performance category, but unable to receive two prizes. Mobil Research and Thinking<br> Machines, used the CM-2 for seismic data processing and achieved the higher ratio of 500<br> Mflops/$1M. The judges decided on one award per entry.[3][2] His method involved each<br> microprocessor communicating with six neighbors.[10]

        <p>Emeagwali's simulation was the first program to apply a pseudo-time approach to <br>reservoir modeling.[1]</p>
